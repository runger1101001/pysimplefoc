## Setup PC side

1. Install python dependencies:

```
pip install pyserial reactivex simplefoc
```

2. Set up your serial connection to the driver.

3. Decide on protocol to use: Commander or Packets, and if Packets, ASCII or Binary

4. Write and run some python code (see our [examples](./examples/))

## Setup Driver side

On the arduino (driver) side, you will need appropriate firmware to enable the communcation between the driver and the python program on the PC.

Depending on your protocol choices, the firmware needs to be written in different ways. Also, because people generally use their motors in the context of specific projects, you may need to *extend* the communication protocol with message types specific to your use case.

To get you started, take a look at the examples in the examples in the [arduino](./examples/arduino/) directory.

These examples include a generic setup that should work on many MCUs. If you've already used SimpleFOC you should find the code quite easy to understand. 

You will have to adapt the pins defined in the examples to match the connections of your setup, then you can compile and flash the firmware to your driver.

Typically a firmware adapted for python control should initialize everything with sensible default values (sensor, driver and motor), initialize communications according to the chosen protocol, and then disable the motor and wait for control input. The examples are structured in this way.

## CLI tools usage

The library comes with a few ready-to-use command line tools, you can find them in the [utilities](./utilities/) folder.

### simplefoc-cli

Send commands to the driver directly from the command line. Supports all the protocols and various command line options.

```plain
usage: simplefoc-cli.py [-h] [-b BAUD] [-m MOTORID] [-v] [-t {commander,binary,ascii}] port commands [commands ...]

PySimpleFOC Command Line Interface

positional arguments:
  port                  Serial port to use
  commands              One or more commands or register=value pairs, separated by spaces

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BAUD, --baud BAUD  Baud rate
  -m MOTORID, --motorid MOTORID
                        Motor ID (a number for binary or ascii protocol types, a letter for commander protocol type), default is M
  -v, --verbose         Verbose output
  -t {commander,binary,ascii}, --type {commander,binary,ascii}
                        Protocol type, default is commander
```

### simplefoc-telemetry

Dump telemetry data from serial to a variety of different formats.

```plain
usage: simplefoc-telemetry.py [-h] [--baud BAUD] [--type {binary,ascii}] [--verbose] [--motors MOTORS [MOTORS ...]] [--downsample DOWNSAMPLE] [--samples SAMPLES] [--seconds SECONDS] [--format {python,tabbed,csv,json,binary}] [--print] [--output OUTPUT] [--mqtt MQTT] [--influx INFLUX] [--nohup NOHUP] [--header] [--echo ECHO] port [registers ...]

PySimpleFOC Telemetry Tool

positional arguments:
  port                  Serial port to use
  registers             Set registers to monitor on MCU

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --baud BAUD           Baud rate
  --type {binary,ascii}
                        Protocol type
  --verbose             Verbose output
  --motors MOTORS [MOTORS ...]
                        Motor IDs, use on multi-motor setups. Provide either a single value, or as many motor-ids as registers
  --downsample DOWNSAMPLE
                        Set telemetry downsample value on MCU
  --samples SAMPLES     Stop after this many samples
  --seconds SECONDS     Stop after this many seconds
  --format {python,tabbed,csv,json,binary}
                        Output format
  --print               Print to stdout
  --output OUTPUT       Output to file
  --mqtt MQTT           MQTT server in the form: mqtt://user:pass@broker:port/topic?clientid=xyz
  --influx INFLUX       InfluxDB server
  --nohup NOHUP         Don't stop telemetry
  --header              Print header at start of output
  --echo ECHO           Print command responses to stdout
```


## Library usage

Using the python API is quite simple, the following examples show use of the 'commander' protocol:

```python
import simplefoc

commander = simplefoc.commander.serial("COM1", 115200)
commander.connect()

motor = commander.full_control('M')
motor.set_target(10)
```

Various easy to use methods are pre-defined to interact with the motor:

```python
motor.set_limits(max_voltage=12.0, max_current=1.0, max_velocity=20.0)
motor.set_mode(MotionControlType.torque, TorqueControlType.voltage)
motor.enable()
```

But you can also just send commands as strings, anything Commander will understand on the driver side:

```python
commander.send_command('ME0')
```

Often, in python we will be interested in processing the telemetry data from the motor. Commander supports telemetry via the SimpleFOC motor monitoring, but you have to let the python side know which values are being sent:

```python
motor.set_monitoring(SimpleFOCRegisters.REG_ANGLE, SimpleFOCRegisters.REG_VELOCITY)
motor.start_monitoring()
```

The telemetry stream is a reactive observable to which you can subscribe:

```python
motor.telemetry().subscribe(lambda x: print(x))
```

## Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks (see [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org) for more information) are a great way to run experiments involving SimpleFOC and visualizing the results.

Because of the need for local serial port access, you have to install and run jupyter on your PC and can't use the cloud version. Don't worry, it's easy to install.

See the [jupyter](./jupyter/) folder for some examples to get you up and running.
